<!-- v0.0.3: Live preview, documentation guides, and Alert Box -->

Theres now a dedicated documentation page, for guide and tutorials. So, the main page is can be used for more interractive live preview.

I should've look more into the itch.io layout more. There's more variables that I didn't make use of. Like the button color, border color, and many more. So, say goodbye to the `color-mix` function.

But theres one limitation: these components can't be used in jam pages or profile pages, atleast for now. Since those pages don't have some of the color variables required. <span class="custom-hd">(Well its not exactly that you *can't* use them, it just won't appear properly. But I still advise to not use them in jam or profile pages)</span>

Also, im rebranding the name. 'Game Page Components' seems too bland and generic.

### Changelog:

    - Added dedicated documentation page
    - Added Live preview section on the main page
        - With toggle-able themes and resizeable window

    - Remove margin and outline from Inputs
    - Remove vertical margin for Labels that are placed within `<p>`. So that it can be used inbetween text.
    - `.custom-tag` variant of Label now use constant `font-size`
